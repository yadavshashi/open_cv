# Motion Detection using OpenCV

This is a basic motion detection program built using Python and OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, processes each frame to detect motion, and highlights moving objects using bounding boxes.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Real-time video capture
- Frame differencing for motion detection
- Contour detection to localize movement
- Simple and lightweight â€“ no machine learning involved

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- imutils

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils
